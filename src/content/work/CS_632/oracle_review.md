Review URL contex: [softwareadvice](https://www.softwareadvice.com/data-governance/oracle-database-profile/reviews/)

  
This is a review aggregation site, bit to find it you can filter by 1 star and used for less then 12 months.

Section being refrenced: 
> The documentation is lacking and the most useful guides are provided by [sensitive content hidden] who unfortunately passed away this year.  
> It really has a hard learning curve and the prices are extremely high.  
> For a core, the prices started from $16k + taxes plus $5k + taxes for annual support.  
> Also, you can't install Oracle on any common cloud environment as it will try to force you to buy licenses for all the capacity of the hypervisor.   
> A basic Oracle specialized server costs nearly $500 a month with a major ISP provider in my country. This is not viable for a starting company.

I am a strong propoent for open sources software for things like the review above! While Oracle databases have a lot of powerful fuctinality, its far harder to learn them and harder to find / create educatinal content for new users looking to learn. In comparison, open source databases like postgress have exploded in popularity because they are free to self host, and anyone can spin it up in a few minuits. This helps people who created educatinal content, who then promote the database to their users.
I also find that while PL/SQL is a very powerfull tool, it results in a very strong vendor lock in. In the moder age of computing, I can't fathom why anyone would pay so much for a database when they can get a better, more open, and more extensavle one for free.
